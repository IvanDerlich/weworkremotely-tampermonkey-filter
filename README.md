# We Work Remotely Tampermonkey Filter

Filter results on We Work Remotely to remove jobs that are less relevant to you using [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

This is a relatively simply script that scans the DOM on pages like [this one](https://weworkremotely.com/categories/remote-front-end-programming-jobs) from WWR to remove job entries that might not be relevant to your job search.

You should take script and customize it your own needs to filter out other things.
